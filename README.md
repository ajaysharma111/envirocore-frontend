🌱 EnviroCore — Campus Carbon Footprint Dashboard

EnviroCore is a web-based sustainability dashboard designed to help educational institutions monitor, visualize, and reduce their carbon footprint at the building level. It enables campuses to track electricity, water, and paper usage and receive actionable recommendations to lower emissions.

🌍 Use Case

EnviroCore is designed for: • Colleges and universities • Smart campuses • Sustainability initiatives • Awareness and decision-support systems

It helps institutions understand where emissions come from, what actions reduce them, and what happens if no action is taken.

⸻

📈 Example Workflow 1. Login or Sign up 2. Add buildings with usage data 3. View emissions in charts 4. Read smart recommendations 5. Export sustainability reports

⸻

🎯 Purpose

The goal of EnviroCore is not perfect scientific modeling but: • Awareness • Actionability • Simplicity • Educational impact

It encourages institutions to make informed sustainability decisions using data.

⸻

🔮 Future Scope • IoT sensor integration for automatic data input • AI-based predictive emissions forecasting • Mobile app version • Multi-campus benchmarking • Government sustainability reporting integration
